abstract = {A new type of grammar for generating formal languages, called an
                  indexed grammar, is presented. An indexed grammar is an
                  extension of a context-free grammar, and the class of
                  languages generated by indexed grammars has closure properties
                  and decidability results similar to those for context-free
                  languages. The class of languages generated by indexed
                  grammars properly includes all context-free languages and is a
                  proper subset of the class of context-sensitive
                  languages. Several subclasses of indexed grammars generate
                  interesting classes of languages.},

abstract = {A programming language called Pascal is described which was developed on the basis ofAlgol 60. Compared toAlgol 60, its range of applicability is considerably increased due to a variety of data structuring facilities. In view of its intended usage both as a convenient basis to teach programming and as an efficient tool to write large programs, emphasis was placed on keeping the number of fundamental concepts reasonably small, on a simple and systematic language structure, and on efficient implementability. A one-pass compiler has been constructed for the CDC 6000 computer family; it is expressed entirely in terms of Pascal itself.},
